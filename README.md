# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was about Weather Forecast. In this project i will create an API on weather app and get the data from api and call my weatherapp data from the api and create the componets and render data inside it and create a context and add the whole functioality inside it.when we search the country or city name that will get the current data from the api and after that displayed on the screen after loading. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
